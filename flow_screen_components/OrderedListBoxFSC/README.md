This OrderedListBox is hardcoded to a custom object called ApprovalProcessDefinition__c. As such, it can't be effectively packaged and reused by anyone in any application the way that most of 
the screen components here can. 

For now, this is provided as some code that you can use to create your own object-specific version. 

The Flow team is working on the ability to have Flow work with LWC's that express generic types, which will allow for flexible screen 
components that work with any custom or standard object.
