# Dynamic Picklist #

 ## Consider using [QuickChoice](https://github.com/alexed1/LightningFlowComponents/tree/master/flow_screen_components/quickChoiceFSCproject), which provides additional functionality ##

### A Flow Extension  ###

This component grabs picklist values and creates a Lightning Design System styled picklist populated with those values.

## How It Works ##

This component exposes three input attributes "object", "field", and "value". Simply pass the desired sObject name and picklist field name on that object and the picklist values will populate. The selected value is passed to an output attribute called "value". If "value" is supplied a valid input value, it will be used as the default value.
