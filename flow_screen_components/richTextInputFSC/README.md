Rich Text enhancements for Flows

### Summary:
IMPORTANT:  Use enabledAdvancedTools = true input attribute if you want to leverage these enhanced features.  Otherwise leave empty and regular input Rich Text component will be used.
1)	Warn or Block Transition in Flow if disallowed words and/or symbols are present.
2)	Find and Replace
3)	Auto-Replace suggested words
4)	Undo functionality for search/replace or suggested words
5)  Character Count and Max Character limits.

### Admin Instructions:
##### Enabling and Disabling Features in Flow:
1)  Default function is regular rich text input field.  To enable advanced features set enableAdvancedTools to true.
2)  Setting label provides a field label for the rich text input.
3)  Rich Text input/output is provided through the value attribute.
##### Configure the default Rich Text Features in Flow:
1)  By default, all rich text features (called formats) like bold, italic, image etc. are enabled.
2)  Optionally, specify the exact formats you want to allow by providing a comma-separated list with formats to the "Enabled Formats" attribute. Example: bold, image
3)  Optionally, disable certain categories by providing a comma-separated list with categories to the "Disabled Categories" attribute. Example: INSERT_CONTENT, ALIGN_TEXT
4)  The complete list of formats and categories can be accessed in the Input Rich Text documentation on:
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-input-rich-text/documentation
##### Replace Text with Suggested Terms:
1)  If autoReplaceMap is populated, then a button is shown to user.
2)  Use autoReplaceMap to set up key:value pairs in JSON.  Example: {"Test":"GreatTest™"}
     a.  When user employs the button, the key will be replace by value.
##### Managing Disallowed Words and Symbols:
1)  If disallowedSymbols or disallowedWords is filled, then user will be notified while typing one of those words or symbols.
2)  Both disallowedSymbols and disallowedWords accept a comma delimited string.
3)  The default message will say 'Error' and provide the violating word/symbol.  This will also give validation error if user tries to advance while error is still present.
4)  To change the message to a warning only, and turn off the associated validation (allowing user to advance the Flow), set warnOnly attribute to true.
##### Character Counts and Limits:
1)  Character count is off by default.  Set characterLimit to an integer value to show character count and limit.  
2)  If warnOnly is not set when characterLimit is on, then the Flow Next/Finish cannot be used until resolved.
