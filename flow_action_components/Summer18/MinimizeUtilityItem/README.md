# MinimizeUtilityItem - Finish your utility bar embeded Flow by closing it #

### A Flow Action extension  ###

This Flow element causes the open utility bar item to minimize. This works great for flows embeded in a utility bar that need to close when they reach the end instead of starting over.

Important Operations Notes:
This flow action does NOT work when run from Flow Setup. It ONLY works when run on a Lightning Page. (Even if you're using Lightning Experience, the Flow Setup page is an old "Classic" page, and has some limitations in how it executes flows. )

## How It Works ##

This component has no editable attributes. It will call the UtilityBarAPI method that closes the open utility bar item.
