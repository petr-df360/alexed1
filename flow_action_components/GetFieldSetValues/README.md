# GetFieldSetValues

Grabs all of the fields in a FieldSet into a text collection or comma-separated string for use in Flow. 

Useful in the following actions: RecordDetailFSC, ExecuteSOQL, and any other action that takes in a string of field names.

NOTE: To get the test class to pass you will need the sample field set included in the repo. You may also just modify it and use your own. This was included because Saleforce does not allow you to create Field Sets in a test class.
