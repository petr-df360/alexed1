Flow Process Components are screen-oriented LWC components that are intended to be used by developers to build things like Custom Property Editors for Flow Actions and Flow Screen Components. 

Although they're very visual, they're not intended to be dropped by admins directly into Flow Screens. Components that are optimized for that can be found in the Flow Screen Components directory.
