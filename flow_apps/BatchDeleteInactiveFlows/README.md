# BatchDeleteInactiveFlows

Lightning App: **BatchDeleteInactiveFlows**

**  This App is designed to present a List of all versions of all Process Builders and Flows in an Org.  The App is also built to allow an Admin to select multiple inactive versions and bulk delete them in a single action.  The App includes a configurable List View, List View with batch selection for delete and a Flow Picker where you can select a single Flow or Process Builder and then work with a List View of all of its active and inactive versions.**
